# Positive Discipline Schweiz

### About the Site
This is a site for the business of KC Hill and his classes on Positive Discipline (PD). It provides contact information and forms, details on upcoming classes, a list of relevant literature, and information on the history and practices of PD.

The site uses Firebase Auth for admin login, allowing KC to update the content of the site in a Firestore database.

### Tech Stack
* React/Redux/Thunks

### Future Goals
Future iterations will include:
* Signup forms for classes with logic to prevent further signups after a limit on the class has been reached.
* Analytics on visitors to the site to determine relevant locations for potential future classes.
